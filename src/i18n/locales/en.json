    "votingWeight": "An account with a minimum of {{minWeight}} BANANO or >= 0.1% of the online voting weight delegated to it is required to get the Principal Representative status.

    "unknownLastTransaction": "Transaction dates were introduced in February 2019. Prior to that date, the transaction times were not recorded locally on the nodes. The reason why the last transaction date is unknown is because it was confirmed before the dates were recorded or before the BananoLooker node was in service.",
